# Project Description

In urban geography, a city is characterized as a patchwork of intensive land-uses (Storper & Scott, 2016). The function of a particular patch of land and its physical character is socially defined. However, research that rigorously establishes the link between the physical character of a given piece of land with 'use' is lacking despite the proliferation of geospatial data. Linking a city's physical form with its function(s) is the goal of this project. 

## Land-cover
In geographical literature, land-cover is generally understood as the physical composition of the features on the earth's surface (Cihlar & Jansen, 2001). 

## Land-use
In contrast to land-cover, land-use is a description of how people use the land.
